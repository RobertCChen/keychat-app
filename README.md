# keychat

## Roadmap

 0. Figure out Keybase key management: How do we avoid users copying & pasting keys?
 1. Basic chat app (no encryption, but add accounts and passwords so we can later decrypt Keybase key w/ password)
 2. Add encryption with dummy public keys
 3. Add lookup public keys against Keybase root
 4. Verify keybase root before allowing lookups on it
